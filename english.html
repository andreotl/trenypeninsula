      <h4>2023</h4>
    <h2 class="upper">El Tren y la Península is a deep dive into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula as the 1500 km railroad megaproject is being built. <br>A cinematic journey along the projected route of the train takes us on a thrilling ride across the Peninsula. <br>Through the fascinating stories and reflections of its inhabitants, the documentary unravels the environmental and social consequences of the development model imposed on the region as the train approaches its inauguration.
                      <br>The incisive and transparent testimonies of the inhabitants of the Peninsula weave together a collective story and reveal a human landscape full of vitality and wisdom that exposes the clash between different ways of imagining progress. <br>An urgent film that unveils the worlds hidden behind the tourist paradise that everyone knows, delving into the ideological and territorial battles that unfold in the ancestral land of the Maya.</h2>
      <h3 class="upper"> The Yucatan Peninsula is a unique region in the world that has seen enormous transformations through time; starting with the Chicxulub meteorite impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs; the flourishing of the Maya culture; colonization; the atrocities of the hacienda times; the caste war or the founding of the city of Cancún: the Yucatan Peninsula has been the center of monumental events that have transformed it time and time again. <br>Its inhabitants, heirs of a rich Maya legacy, have remained in these lands navigating the challenges that have been presented to them throughout history. With the announcement of the arrival of the so-called "Maya Train" a new event of profound impact is on the horizon.<br>
                         The peninsula is a beautiful region. <br>Its economic growth in recent decades has centered on its natural and cultural wealth, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. <br>While people from far and wide visit the region to enjoy and experience "paradise," the economic forces behind this enormous global interest have been transforming life on the peninsula and its surroundings at a dizzying pace. <br>The tourist industry has consequently established an elitist social order, while at the same time fostering massive environmental depredation and a spiral of violence generated by drug traffickers struggling to supply drugs to the insatiable appetite of tourists.<br>
                         In the midst of the pandemic, when the world seemed to stop, the construction of the "Maya Train", the most ambitious project of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, began. <br>It was presented as a project that will boost the region's economy and bring social well-being to the population through the creation of a railway circuit connecting the main cities and tourist destinations. <br>The "Maya Train" project intends to carry out a profound territorial reorganization and channel definitively the development of the region. While the most appropriate development model for the peninsula and its inhabitants is being debated, the advance of the train generates great concerns about the environmental and social consequences it will entail. 
                         <br>Taking into account the complex history of dispossession, exploitation and destruction of the peninsula, it is important to unravel the challenges and dangers, as well as the promises and proposals that the train carries in order to avoid reproducing the destructive inequalities that the peninsula has dragged for centuries.</h3>
